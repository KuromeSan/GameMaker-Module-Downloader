# GameMaker-Module-Downloader
Minimalistic program to download gamemaker export modules


Q) Why?                   
A) Because gamemaker updater is very shit and keeps failing to download                 
and modding the updater got annoying fast so i just made my own program for it ;d

Q) Can i pirate with this?                
A) This progrma only downloads whats set in "Addons" from license.plist.                 
even if you edit the code to download everything, its not enough.              
because the 5piceIDE will check if you own the exports before enabling them              

Q) Where does it download from?                    
A) directly from YoYo Games Server.
